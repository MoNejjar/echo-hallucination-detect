# Echo: Prompt Refinement for Hallucination-Free LLMs

Welcome to **Echo** — an AI-powered assistant that helps you write better prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) by detecting and refining parts that are likely to cause hallucinations.

---

## 🔍 What Is Echo?

**Echo** is a lightweight tool designed to **detect hallucination potential** in user-written prompts and **guide users through a conversational refinement process**. It empowers non-experts to create clearer, more faithful instructions for LLMs — without needing to fine-tune models or write advanced prompt logic.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

LLMs are impressive — but they often generate *hallucinations*: factually incorrect, logically inconsistent, or unfaithful outputs. A major cause? Poorly structured or ambiguous prompts.

**Echo** tackles this challenge head-on by:

* Identifying hallucination-prone segments of prompts 🧩
* Explaining why those segments are risky 🗣️
* Helping users rewrite prompts via an intuitive feedback loop 🔄

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Prompt Submission**: Users submit a prompt into a simple web interface.
2. **Token Analysis**: Echo uses an LLM-based backend to assess segments that could mislead or confuse the model.
3. **Feedback Loop**: The system flags issues and explains them clearly, then enters a conversational refinement process with the user.
4. **Iteration**: With each iteration, the prompt becomes clearer and more model-aligned — reducing hallucination risk.

## 🧪 Research Foundations

This project is based on a bachelor’s thesis at the **Technical University of Munich**, exploring:

* Causes of faithfulness hallucinations in LLMs
* Model-agnostic techniques for hallucination detection
* Interactive systems for prompt optimization
